                <p class="title">Musician. Guitarist. Web Developer.</p>
                <p>I am an entrepreneur, musician and an educator based in LA. Recently, I had the honor to perform at the prestigious Carnegie Hall in NY. Not long ago, I took my first steps into the Web Development field. I look forward to continuing my education in the tech world and learning by contributing into projects.
                As an educator, I have an extensive experience in teaching group and private guitar and music lessons in multiple high schools and music academies. Currently, I manage my private music studio with more than 40 students enrolled, from different age groups and skill levels.</p>
